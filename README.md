# 🌍 Discover Places

An intelligent, lightweight platform to discover, recommend, and explore places — built with Flask, HTML, and machine learning magic.

## 🧠 What is *Discover Places*?

**Discover Places** is a web-based application that helps users find interesting places, get smart recommendations, and navigate to them using Google Maps. Unlike traditional search engines, this platform learns from **user preferences** and **place data** to offer relevant suggestions using **machine learning models**.

✅ Think TripAdvisor meets a personal recommender, but simpler and smarter.

## 🧠 Recommendation Engines

Inside the `recommendation/` folder:

* `content_based.py`: Uses metadata similarity (e.g., category, tags) to find similar places.
* `popularity.py`: Ranks based on user interactions (likes, views, etc.).

Each can be imported and run independently or integrated directly into Flask routes.

---

## 📍 How Mapping Works

* **GoMapsPro API** is used to fetch detailed place data.
* When a user clicks the address, they are redirected to **Google Maps** for directions.
